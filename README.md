# Revolutionary Musical Keyboard and Multi-Function Controller (RMKMC)

## Overview
The RMKMC is a 3D printed, ESP32-powered musical instrument and controller. It features 8 keys, each assignable to different tones, and a touch-detecting mechanism facilitated by 30 cm-long breadboard cables hidden beneath the keys. The RMKMC communicates via Bluetooth with a smartphone or PC and acts as a standard keyboard. It also includes a hidden smartphone mount with print-in-place hinges and a unique release mechanism, making it perfect for streamers. The RMKMC can also communicate with OctoPrint for basic 3D printer controls.
